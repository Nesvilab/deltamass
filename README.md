This program will plot mass-differences from a proteomic "Open Search".
An "Open Search" is any search of fragmentation spectra (MS2) against a
protein database when the precursor mass tolerance was set to a high
enough value. E.g. not the usual 5-10-20 ppm, but instead 50-100-200 Da.
The result of such a search is quite different from the regular one, it
might contain a lot of spurious hits, but a lot of hits will still
correspond to reasonable matches.

The differences in mass between the observed value for a precursor and
the theoretical peptide mass from a database might be many Daltons.
Nevertheless, you'll still see lots of similar mass differences, which
should correspond to Post Translational Modifications (PTMs) or
chemical modifications or other artifacts in the data.

After performing an Open Search you might want to identify the
differences to maybe include them into the variable modifications list
of your search engine settings. You might also discover unexpected
artifacts, like chemical derivatives of peptides occurring because of
your sample preparation protocols etc.

This is where this program comes into play.

## Running
Download the **jar** file from the [Releases](https://github.com/chhh/deltamass/releases) section.

##### *GUI*
- On Windows you can just start the `.exe` file from the [Downloads](https://github.com/chhh/deltamass/releases).
- Run `java -jar deltamass-x.x.jar gui` to launch the GUI. You might want to
include a JVM switch `-Xmx2G` (change the number to the amount of gigabytes of
memory you'll allow the process to consume), so the command becomes:  
`java -jar -Xmx2G deltamass-x.x.jar gui`

##### *Command line*
Run `java -jar deltamass-x.x.jar` to see the help, it will print available *commands*.  
To print help/usage for a specific command add `command -h`, e.g. 
`java -jar deltamass-x.x.jar peaks -h`
There are quite a few options there and it might seem overwhelming at
first, so you might want to try the GUI version first.

## Plot navigation
 * Left Mouse Button = __LMB__, Right Mouse Button = __RMB__.
 * __Zoom__ - `LMB drag to the right`. Zooms in mass axis, Y-axis automatically
 adjusts to fit all peaks. Or use `Mouse Wheel`. Check context menu options to
 change the behavior.
 * __Un-zoom__ - `LMB drag to the left`. Unzooms the mass axis completely, BUT
 keeps the current Y axis zoom. To restore Y-axis zoom as well use `Mouse Wheel`
  once after full zoom out. You can use `Mouse Wheel` to zoom out.
 * __Pan__ - `Hold Ctrl + LMB drag`. WIll pan X axis only, moving the view left
 and right.
 * `Mouse Wheel` - __zoom__ in/out onto the X point currently under cursor.
 * `LMB click` - __Selection__. Places  two vertical guides to denote the region
 currently displayed in the Info Window. The Info Window will list known
 modifications in this range of masses and also list peptides from your search
 results that fall into this range.
 * `RMB click` - options for the plot (__Preferences__), you can also save the
 plot from here (prefer saving to _PNG_) and change how zooming works.
